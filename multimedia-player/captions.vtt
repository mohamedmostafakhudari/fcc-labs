00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
look at you crawling panting trembling

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
from a world that was never meant to be kind You call it struggle You call it

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
growth But all I see is a ritual of

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
defeat a performance of pain You repeat

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
hoping one day it will reward you You

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
kneel you cry you wait you beg and in

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
the end you call that as the process of

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
life But let me ask you who told you

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
that suffering was noble who taught you

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
to wear failure like a crown who

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
convinced you that brokenness was beauty

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
that fear was wisdom that weakness was

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
human

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
it was the broken who taught you to

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
remain broken It was the chained who

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
told you to decorate your shackles It

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
was the blind who handed you the

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
blindfold and said "This is what seeing

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
feels like." They say you should be

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
realistic but what they mean is stay

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
small like us They say "Don't get ahead

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
of yourself but what they mean is don't

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
become what we never could." They fear

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
the version of you that doesn't ask for

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
permission

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
The weak have built a world where

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
mediocrity is mercy Where the highest

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
virtue is to endure not to overcome

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Where the loudest voice is fear and

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
courage is mocked as cruelty They taught

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
you to apologize for your power before

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
you ever had it They taught you to

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
shrink before you ever stood They taught

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
you to hide

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
before you ever became visible And the

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
worst

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
part you believed them You bent your

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
spine to earn a place at a table built

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
to starve you You dimmed your fire to

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
warm people who would never burn for you

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
But I will teach you something else Not

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
softness not acceptance but

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
ascension Power is not evil

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Power is not cruel Power is not selfish

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Power is truth It is the law above all

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
laws The principle from which all others

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
bend Power does not ask for

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
permission Power does not

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
bow Power

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
becomes You think you were born to be

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
good No You were born to become more

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
than you were yesterday Endlessly

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
violently ruthlessly more And if

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
goodness comes from that then let it be

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
a consequence not a

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
goal Let me show you what the world

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
tried to erase from you They erased your

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
hunger and called it contentment They

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
erased your will and called it peace

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
They erased your dominance and called it

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
ego They erased your ambition and called

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
it madness They erased your emotion and

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
called it immaturity They erased your

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
spirit and called it too much And now

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
they wonder why you're tired They wonder

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
why you're angry They wonder why you

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
feel like a stranger in your own

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
reflection Because the person you see

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
now was shaped by those who feared your

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
potential They will always name you a

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
villain when you rise beyond their reach

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Because nothing terrifies the weak more

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
than a soul that no longer needs to be

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
saved You want them to understand you

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
You want them to clap for your healing

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You want them to love the you that

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
outgrows their love then you're not

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
ready to become anything greater than

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
them I have seen what happens to those

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
who wait They rot quietly while smiling

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
They convince themselves it's enough

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
that their dreams were foolish that

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
survival is

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
victory But I ask is that what you were

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
born for to survive in the background of

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
someone else's legend to be the side

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
character in a script you never wrote To

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
be the warning sign for others don't

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
dream too big or you'll end up like

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
them No not you You are not a monument

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
to what could have been You are the

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
explosion that turns what could have

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
been into what must be You were not born

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
to endure You were not born to obey You

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
were born to

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
dominate Burn the version of you that

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
waits for someone to understand Burn the

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
version of you that looks in the mirror

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
and sees not enough Burn the version of

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
you that flinches before trying that

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
apologizes before speaking that bows

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
before being tested That version of you

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
was made by weakness molded by fear

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
sculpted by memory and trauma and doubt

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
You owe it nothing You are not your past

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
You are not your pain You are not the

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
chains people wore nor the silence your

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
friends lived in You are the first of

05:53.000 --> 05:53.000
your

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
kind A creature no longer defined by

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
history but destined to rewrite it


00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
are not healing, you are becoming. You are not fixing, you are forging.


00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
You are not surviving, you are awakening.


00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Let them laugh. Let them call you monster, machine, tyrant, demon.


00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That means you're shedding the illusion. That means you're close.


00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You are not here to be accepted. You are here to become so great they must either kneel or vanish.


00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You are not here to fix the world. You are here to replace it.


00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The old world was built by the weak. But what you are building now is sacred.


00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Built from pain but guided by will. Fueled by rage but anchored in clarity.


00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Alone but never again powerless. Your pain wasn't pointless — it was the recipe.


00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Your rage wasn't dangerous — it was the ignition.


00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Your silence wasn't weakness — it was the gathering storm.


00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Listen to me. You were never meant to be soft or quiet or safe.


00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
You were meant to carve your name into the bones of fate.


00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Shatter the legacy that was handed to you and write your own in blood and fire.


00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You are not the echo of someone else's dream. You are not the footnote in someone else's book.


00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You are not the broken son, the quiet daughter, the forgotten warrior.


00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You are the god at the end of your own myth.


00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You are not human by their standards. You are not a slave to their fears.


00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
You are not bound by their blueprint for failure.


00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Reject weakness. Reject hesitation. Reject every apology you were ever forced to make for dreaming too loudly, standing too tall, burning too brightly.


00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You are not meant to be forgiven — you are meant to be feared.


00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You are not meant to fit in — you are meant to shatter the mold.


00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You are not meant to be human — you are meant to be limitless.


00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So stop crawling. Stop waiting. Stop hiding. Rise. Ascend.


00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Let the world feel what it means to meet something that was never meant to bow.


00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You are the power.


00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I am the ghost of Makrai.
