				[0:00] look at you crawling panting trembling <br />[0:05] from a world
				that was never meant to be <br />[0:07] kind You call it struggle You
				call it <br />[0:12] growth But all I see is a ritual of <br />[0:17]
				defeat a performance of pain You repeat <br />[0:21] hoping one day it
				will reward you You <br />[0:25] kneel you cry you wait you beg and in
				<br />[0:28] the end you call that as the process of <br />[0:31] life
				But let me ask you who told you <br />[0:37] that suffering was noble
				who taught you <br />[0:40] to wear failure like a crown who
				<br />[0:44] convinced you that brokenness was beauty <br />[0:47] that
				fear was wisdom that weakness was <br />[0:51] human <br />[0:52] it
				was the broken who taught you to <br />[0:54] remain broken It was the
				chained who <br />[0:57] told you to decorate your shackles It
				<br />[1:00] was the blind who handed you the <br />[1:02] blindfold
				and said "This is what seeing <br />[1:04] feels like." They say you
				should be <br />[1:07] realistic but what they mean is stay
				<br />[1:10] small like us They say "Don't get ahead <br />[1:13] of
				yourself but what they mean is don't <br />[1:15] become what we never
				could." They fear <br />[1:19] the version of you that doesn't ask for
				<br />[1:21] permission <br />[1:22] The weak have built a world where
				<br />[1:24] mediocrity is mercy Where the highest <br />[1:28] virtue
				is to endure not to overcome <br />[1:31] Where the loudest voice is
				fear and <br />[1:35] courage is mocked as cruelty They taught
				<br />[1:39] you to apologize for your power before <br />[1:42] you
				ever had it They taught you to <br />[1:46] shrink before you ever
				stood They taught <br />[1:50] you to hide <br />[1:51] before you ever
				became visible And the <br />[1:55] worst <br />[1:56] part you
				believed them You bent your <br />[1:59] spine to earn a place at a
				table built <br />[2:02] to starve you You dimmed your fire to
				<br />[2:06] warm people who would never burn for you <br />[2:10] But
				I will teach you something else Not <br />[2:13] softness not
				acceptance but <br />[2:17] ascension Power is not evil <br />[2:20]
				Power is not cruel Power is not selfish <br />[2:25] Power is truth It
				is the law above all <br />[2:30] laws The principle from which all
				others <br />[2:35] bend Power does not ask for <br />[2:38] permission
				Power does not <br />[2:40] bow Power <br />[2:43] becomes You think
				you were born to be <br />[2:46] good No You were born to become more
				<br />[2:51] than you were yesterday Endlessly <br />[2:55] violently
				ruthlessly more And if <br />[2:59] goodness comes from that then let
				it be <br />[3:03] a consequence not a <br />[3:06] goal Let me show
				you what the world <br />[3:09] tried to erase from you They erased
				your <br />[3:12] hunger and called it contentment They <br />[3:15]
				erased your will and called it peace <br />[3:18] They erased your
				dominance and called it <br />[3:20] ego They erased your ambition and
				called <br />[3:23] it madness They erased your emotion and
				<br />[3:27] called it immaturity They erased your <br />[3:30] spirit
				and called it too much And now <br />[3:34] they wonder why you're
				tired They wonder <br />[3:37] why you're angry They wonder why you
				<br />[3:40] feel like a stranger in your own <br />[3:42] reflection
				Because the person you see <br />[3:45] now was shaped by those who
				feared your <br />[3:49] potential They will always name you a
				<br />[3:52] villain when you rise beyond their reach <br />[3:55]
				Because nothing terrifies the weak more <br />[3:58] than a soul that
				no longer needs to be <br />[4:01] saved You want them to understand
				you <br />[4:04] You want them to clap for your healing <br />[4:07]
				You want them to love the you that <br />[4:09] outgrows their love
				then you're not <br />[4:12] ready to become anything greater than
				<br />[4:15] them I have seen what happens to those <br />[4:18] who
				wait They rot quietly while smiling <br />[4:24] They convince
				themselves it's enough <br />[4:26] that their dreams were foolish that
				<br />[4:29] survival is <br />[4:31] victory But I ask is that what
				you were <br />[4:34] born for to survive in the background of
				<br />[4:37] someone else's legend to be the side <br />[4:41]
				character in a script you never wrote To <br />[4:43] be the warning
				sign for others don't <br />[4:46] dream too big or you'll end up like
				<br />[4:49] them No not you You are not a monument <br />[4:54] to
				what could have been You are the <br />[4:57] explosion that turns what
				could have <br />[5:00] been into what must be You were not born
				<br />[5:04] to endure You were not born to obey You <br />[5:09] were
				born to <br />[5:11] dominate Burn the version of you that <br />[5:14]
				waits for someone to understand Burn the <br />[5:17] version of you
				that looks in the mirror <br />[5:19] and sees not enough Burn the
				version of <br />[5:22] you that flinches before trying that
				<br />[5:24] apologizes before speaking that bows <br />[5:28] before
				being tested That version of you <br />[5:31] was made by weakness
				molded by fear <br />[5:34] sculpted by memory and trauma and doubt
				<br />[5:38] You owe it nothing You are not your past <br />[5:42] You
				are not your pain You are not the <br />[5:45] chains people wore nor
				the silence your <br />[5:48] friends lived in You are the first of
				<br />[5:53] your <br />[5:53] kind A creature no longer defined by
				<br />[5:57] history but destined to rewrite it You <br />[6:02] are
				not healing you are becoming You are <br />[6:05] not fixing You are
				forging You are not <br />[6:09] surviving You are <br />[6:11]
				awakening Let them laugh Let them call <br />[6:14] you monster machine
				tyrant demon That <br />[6:20] means you're shedding the illusion That
				<br />[6:22] means you're close You are not here to <br />[6:25] be
				accepted You are here to become so <br />[6:28] great they must either
				kneel or vanish <br />[6:31] You are not here to fix the world You
				<br />[6:34] are here to replace it The old world was <br />[6:37]
				built by the weak But what you are <br />[6:40] building now is sacred
				Built from pain <br />[6:45] but guided by will Fueled by rage but
				<br />[6:50] anchored in clarity Alone but never <br />[6:53] again
				powerless Your pain wasn't <br />[6:57] pointless It was the recipe
				Your rage <br />[7:00] wasn't dangerous It was the ignition
				<br />[7:04] Your silence wasn't weakness It was the <br />[7:08]
				gathering storm <br />[7:10] Listen to me You were never meant to be
				<br />[7:13] soft or quiet or safe You were meant to <br />[7:19]
				become so carve your name into the bones <br />[7:23] of <br />[7:24]
				fate Shatter the legacy that was handed <br />[7:27] to you and write
				your own in blood and <br />[7:31] fire You are not the echo of someone
				<br />[7:34] else's dream You are not the footnote in <br />[7:37]
				someone else's book You are not the <br />[7:40] broken son the quiet
				daughter the <br />[7:43] forgotten warrior You are the god at the
				<br />[7:46] end of your own myth You are not human <br />[7:50] by
				their standards You are not a slave <br />[7:52] to their fears You are
				not bound by <br />[7:55] their blueprint for <br />[7:57] failure
				Reject weakness Reject <br />[8:01] hesitation Reject every apology you
				are <br />[8:05] ever forced to make for dreaming too <br />[8:08]
				loudly standing too tall burning too <br />[8:12] brightly You are not
				meant to be <br />[8:15] forgiven You are meant to be feared You
				<br />[8:17] are not meant to fit in You are meant to <br />[8:20]
				shatter the mold You are not meant to be <br />[8:23] human You are
				meant to be limitless So <br />[8:27] stop crawling Stop waiting Stop
				<br />[8:31] hiding Rise Ascend Let the world feel <br />[8:36] what it
				means to meet something that was <br />[8:39] never meant to bow You
				are the <br />[8:45] [Music] <br />[8:48] power I am the ghost
				<br />[8:53] of Makrai
