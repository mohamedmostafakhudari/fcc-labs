0:00
look at you crawling panting trembling
0:05
from a world that was never meant to be
0:07
kind You call it struggle You call it
0:12
growth But all I see is a ritual of
0:17
defeat a performance of pain You repeat
0:21
hoping one day it will reward you You
0:25
kneel you cry you wait you beg and in
0:28
the end you call that as the process of
0:31
life But let me ask you who told you
0:37
that suffering was noble who taught you
0:40
to wear failure like a crown who
0:44
convinced you that brokenness was beauty
0:47
that fear was wisdom that weakness was
0:51
human
0:52
it was the broken who taught you to
0:54
remain broken It was the chained who
0:57
told you to decorate your shackles It
1:00
was the blind who handed you the
1:02
blindfold and said "This is what seeing
1:04
feels like." They say you should be
1:07
realistic but what they mean is stay
1:10
small like us They say "Don't get ahead
1:13
of yourself but what they mean is don't
1:15
become what we never could." They fear
1:19
the version of you that doesn't ask for
1:21
permission
1:22
The weak have built a world where
1:24
mediocrity is mercy Where the highest
1:28
virtue is to endure not to overcome
1:31
Where the loudest voice is fear and
1:35
courage is mocked as cruelty They taught
1:39
you to apologize for your power before
1:42
you ever had it They taught you to
1:46
shrink before you ever stood They taught
1:50
you to hide
1:51
before you ever became visible And the
1:55
worst
1:56
part you believed them You bent your
1:59
spine to earn a place at a table built
2:02
to starve you You dimmed your fire to
2:06
warm people who would never burn for you
2:10
But I will teach you something else Not
2:13
softness not acceptance but
2:17
ascension Power is not evil
2:20
Power is not cruel Power is not selfish
2:25
Power is truth It is the law above all
2:30
laws The principle from which all others
2:35
bend Power does not ask for
2:38
permission Power does not
2:40
bow Power
2:43
becomes You think you were born to be
2:46
good No You were born to become more
2:51
than you were yesterday Endlessly
2:55
violently ruthlessly more And if
2:59
goodness comes from that then let it be
3:03
a consequence not a
3:06
goal Let me show you what the world
3:09
tried to erase from you They erased your
3:12
hunger and called it contentment They
3:15
erased your will and called it peace
3:18
They erased your dominance and called it
3:20
ego They erased your ambition and called
3:23
it madness They erased your emotion and
3:27
called it immaturity They erased your
3:30
spirit and called it too much And now
3:34
they wonder why you're tired They wonder
3:37
why you're angry They wonder why you
3:40
feel like a stranger in your own
3:42
reflection Because the person you see
3:45
now was shaped by those who feared your
3:49
potential They will always name you a
3:52
villain when you rise beyond their reach
3:55
Because nothing terrifies the weak more
3:58
than a soul that no longer needs to be
4:01
saved You want them to understand you
4:04
You want them to clap for your healing
4:07
You want them to love the you that
4:09
outgrows their love then you're not
4:12
ready to become anything greater than
4:15
them I have seen what happens to those
4:18
who wait They rot quietly while smiling
4:24
They convince themselves it's enough
4:26
that their dreams were foolish that
4:29
survival is
4:31
victory But I ask is that what you were
4:34
born for to survive in the background of
4:37
someone else's legend to be the side
4:41
character in a script you never wrote To
4:43
be the warning sign for others don't
4:46
dream too big or you'll end up like
4:49
them No not you You are not a monument
4:54
to what could have been You are the
4:57
explosion that turns what could have
5:00
been into what must be You were not born
5:04
to endure You were not born to obey You
5:09
were born to
5:11
dominate Burn the version of you that
5:14
waits for someone to understand Burn the
5:17
version of you that looks in the mirror
5:19
and sees not enough Burn the version of
5:22
you that flinches before trying that
5:24
apologizes before speaking that bows
5:28
before being tested That version of you
5:31
was made by weakness molded by fear
5:34
sculpted by memory and trauma and doubt
5:38
You owe it nothing You are not your past
5:42
You are not your pain You are not the
5:45
chains people wore nor the silence your
5:48
friends lived in You are the first of
5:53
your
5:53
kind A creature no longer defined by
5:57
history but destined to rewrite it You
6:02
are not healing you are becoming You are
6:05
not fixing You are forging You are not
6:09
surviving You are
6:11
awakening Let them laugh Let them call
6:14
you monster machine tyrant demon That
6:20
means you're shedding the illusion That
6:22
means you're close You are not here to
6:25
be accepted You are here to become so
6:28
great they must either kneel or vanish
6:31
You are not here to fix the world You
6:34
are here to replace it The old world was
6:37
built by the weak But what you are
6:40
building now is sacred Built from pain
6:45
but guided by will Fueled by rage but
6:50
anchored in clarity Alone but never
6:53
again powerless Your pain wasn't
6:57
pointless It was the recipe Your rage
7:00
wasn't dangerous It was the ignition
7:04
Your silence wasn't weakness It was the
7:08
gathering storm
7:10
Listen to me You were never meant to be
7:13
soft or quiet or safe You were meant to
7:19
become so carve your name into the bones
7:23
of
7:24
fate Shatter the legacy that was handed
7:27
to you and write your own in blood and
7:31
fire You are not the echo of someone
7:34
else's dream You are not the footnote in
7:37
someone else's book You are not the
7:40
broken son the quiet daughter the
7:43
forgotten warrior You are the god at the
7:46
end of your own myth You are not human
7:50
by their standards You are not a slave
7:52
to their fears You are not bound by
7:55
their blueprint for
7:57
failure Reject weakness Reject
8:01
hesitation Reject every apology you are
8:05
ever forced to make for dreaming too
8:08
loudly standing too tall burning too
8:12
brightly You are not meant to be
8:15
forgiven You are meant to be feared You
8:17
are not meant to fit in You are meant to
8:20
shatter the mold You are not meant to be
8:23
human You are meant to be limitless So
8:27
stop crawling Stop waiting Stop
8:31
hiding Rise Ascend Let the world feel
8:36
what it means to meet something that was
8:39
never meant to bow You are the
8:45
